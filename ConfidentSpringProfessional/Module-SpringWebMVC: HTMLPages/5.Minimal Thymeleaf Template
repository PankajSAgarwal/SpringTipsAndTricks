1. It is time to create the actual index.html template.

2. Create a new directory called templates in the /src/main/_resources folder, and in it an index.html file. Remember, this is the path you configured your templateResolver in your ApplicationConfiguration to use, in the last lesson.

## Unix/Linux/MacOS
cd /src/main
mkdir -p resources/templates
cd resources/templates
touch index.html

3. Give the HTML file the following contents:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>First Thymeleaf Template</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is it!</h1>

<p>Your very first Thymleaf template.</p>
</body>
</html>


• The template, for now, does not contain any variables or any other dynamic data. It is just a static HTML page. Enough, to see if things are set-up correctly.

4. Checkpoint: Adding Thymeleaf

Restart your application and go to http://localhost:8080. You should see this:

*This is it!*

Your very first Thymleaf template.
Congratulations!

Let’s now build a slightly more sophisticated page.
