1. There are a couple of different Thymeleaf versions for each Spring version.

2. If you are using Spring 5, like you are in this course, it is enough to add the following library to your pom.xml file.

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.thymeleaf</groupId>
    <artifactId>thymeleaf-spring5</artifactId> <!-- 1 -->
    <version>3.0.11.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>

3. Alternatives would be thymeleaf-spring4 or thymeleaf-spring3, for Spring 4 and 3, respectively.
