1. So far, you have seen how Springâ€™s core dependency injection container works, including the Spring MVC web framework.

2. Another big part of Spring is its convenience utilities. Some of the most important utilities are for connecting to relational databases(https://www.marcobehler.com/guides/java-databases-jdbc-hibernate-spring-data).

3.This module is how you connect to databases with plain Spring and a library called spring-jdbc.

4.Do not confuse this section with Spring Data JDBC or Spring Data JPA. All utilities covered in this module are available in core Spring framework and are about a decade old.

They form the basis for every other, more advanced Spring Data project later on.
