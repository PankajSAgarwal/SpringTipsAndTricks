This was a short and crisp module.

First, you learned how to add an embedded H2 Database to your project and how to create a DataSource for it.

You then set up a JdbcTemplate to refactor your InvoiceService to execute SQL statements against a real database, instead of saving invoices into an in-memory list.

Finally, you had a quick look at how to set up Springâ€™s @Transactional annotation.
