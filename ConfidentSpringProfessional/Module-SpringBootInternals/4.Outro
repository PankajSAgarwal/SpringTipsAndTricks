This was the deep dive into Spring Boot.

At the beginning you learned about Spring’s AutoConfigurations, how they work thanks to @Conditionals and how they are structured in Spring Boot’s source code.

You then proceeded to write your very own AutoConfiguration.

You should now have a pretty good grasp of Spring Boot!
