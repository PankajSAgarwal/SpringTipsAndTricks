Recap

• When you run the main method of your SpringBootApplication, Spring will run through all of its known (100+) AutoConfiguration classes.

• Every AutoConfiguration is just a normal Spring configuration, but with a ton of added @Conditionals. If those @Conditionals match, then the autoconfigurations are evaluated and beans are automatically created for you.

• Mainly, @Conditionals check if specific properties are set or if dependencies are on the classpath. And that the user hasn’t defined @Beans of specific types himself, already.

• This leads to a lot of functionality working out of the box, whenever you create a new Spring Boot project.

• That’s all there is to Spring Boot’s magic! It’s all just automagically generated beans.
